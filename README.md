# Personal Yomichan Japanese Dictionaries

Repository of the scripts I used to generate several monolingual Japanese dictionaries for the popular Open Source chrome plugin called Yomichan. The scripts output a zip file to be imported inside Yomichan.

Included in the repo are 絵でわかる日本語 from edewakaru.com, 三省堂国語辞典 第7版 from https://www.monokakido.jp/ja/old_product/japanese/sankoku7/, 使い方の分かる 類語例解辞典 and Weblio類語辞書 from thesaurus.weblio.jp

The code used to generate the dictionaries are located inside the folder "my_custom_full_dicts".
